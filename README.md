AIM: Analysis and Visualization of Attendance Data

INTRODUCTION:

Monthly Attendance Report
This report analyzes the monthly attendance data of students for the period from January to May. The attendance data is stored in a CSV file named 'attendance.csv'. The report includes monthly average attendance percentages for each student and visualizes the monthly performance average using a bar graph.

Data Processing:
The attendance data is read from the CSV file using the pandas library.
Percentage strings are converted to float values for each month.
Monthly average attendance percentages are calculated for each student.
The average percentage of each student with their details is stored in a new CSV file. 

Monthly Performance Average:
The bar graph titled 'Monthly Performance Average' visualizes the average attendance percentage for each month (January to May) across all students.

Examination Eligibility:
The script also checks if any student's average attendance percentage falls below 75%. Students with an average attendance below 75% are notified that they will not be able to sit in the examination. Otherwise, a message wishing them all the best for their examination is displayed.









CONCEPTS USED:

Pandas for Data Handling:
Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It's extensively used for handling tabular data, such as CSV files.
In the code, the pd.read_csv() function from pandas is used to read the attendance data from the CSV file into a DataFrame.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The attendance data is preprocessed to convert percentage strings to float values using the str.rstrip('%').astype('float') / 100 operation. This ensures that the attendance values are in a numerical format for further analysis.

Calculation of Monthly Average Percentages:
The monthly average attendance percentages are calculated for each student by taking the mean of their attendance percentages across the months of January to May using data[months].mean(axis=1).

Visualization with Matplotlib:
Matplotlib is a widely-used plotting library in Python for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
The matplotlib.pyplot.bar() function is used to create a bar graph that visualizes the monthly average attendance percentages across all students.

Iterating Over DataFrame Rows:
The iterrows() method is used to iterate over each row of the DataFrame to check if any student's average attendance percentage falls below 75%. This allows for conditional logic to be applied to each row.

Conditional Logic:
Conditional logic is used to determine whether a student is eligible to sit for the examination based on their average attendance percentage. If the average is below 75%, a message indicating ineligibility is printed; otherwise, a message wishing them all the best for the examination is printed.

String Formatting:
String formatting is used to ensure that the output is presented in a clear and readable format. For example, the f"{x:.1f}" syntax is used to format floating-point numbers with one decimal point.

Conclusion:
The provided code efficiently analyzes attendance data, generates valuable insights, and visualizes attendance trends. By calculating monthly average percentages and identifying students with low attendance, educational institutions can effectively monitor and manage student attendance, ensuring compliance with attendance policies and aiding in decision-making processes related to examination eligibility. Additionally, the visualization component enhances the interpretation of attendance data, enabling stakeholders to gain actionable insights for further intervention or support where necessary.
